DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF GAME FOLDER UNLESS YOU ARE CONFIDENT IN UR SKILLS

edit the rpy files, script.rpy is the main, with variables being for any variables you want to add.
the rest can be found in the renpy documentation

ALSO IF YOU ARE EDITING THE MASTER, PLEASE BRANCH IT INSTEAD OF SAVING DIRECTLY TO MASTER

BTW, not all of the script or variables must be in the same file.
  e.g. if the script file is becoming too long, it may be split into two or more files

FURTHERMORE, the storymap in wiki needs to be updated...
